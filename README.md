# nachbarschaftWebApp

Frontend part of a project that was created in course of the module "Software Projekt" at the FH Bielefeld.
This project is not operable without a database and the backend implementation thus the branch frontend_demo
can be checked to get an idea of what our vision was for this project.


## Project setup
```
/nachbarschaftsWebApp
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

/nachbarschaftsWebApp
npm run serve
```

## Credit

This project was realized by Lukas von der Heide, Timon Buschendorf, Jekla Wilczek and Fabian List
